**BREAKING CHANGE**

* Removed `etc_cookbook_files` and `etc_template_files` in favor of
  simpler `bind['included_files']` attribute

Explanation:

  You could, for examplem, drop off other static files or templates in your sysconf
directory.  Then include these files in your named.conf by overriding this attribute.

v0.2.0
------

This is the first cookbook, I have validated with @fnichol re-write
of [test-kitchen](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen).  It took
about 3-4 minutes to validate this cookbook across 4 platforms.

I identified two RHEL 5, and one Ubuntu, recipe bugs which nobody
including myself has caught.  I cannot overstate, how much time this
has saved me.  If you have not tried the test-kitchen re-write,
do yourself the favor and start working with it now.

* Add test-kitchen/Berkshelf skeleton files
* Platform-specific fixes
  - Correct location of `/etc/named.conf` on RHEL 5
  - Added conf_file and options_file are attributes
  - Refactor service actions, and config file rendering
  - Enabled usage of search also on chef-solo via @fabn
  - Various Ubuntu platform fixes via @fabn
  - Added apt recipe to pass test-kitchen
